## [job: free your RStudio console](https://lindeloev.github.io/job)
An R package that allows the user to run code chunks as RStudio jobs. The console is then free to continue working, enabling an uninterrupted coding experience.


## [mcp: Bayesian Inference of Multiple Change Points](https://lindeloev.github.io/mcp/)
An R package that brings great flexibility to the estimation of change points between Generalized Linear Segments. Extensive documentation and worked examples are available on the website.


## [Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats)](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/)
Demonstrates that almost all of the stats 101 tests are special cases of (simple) linear models, including "non-parametric" tests to some approximation. To establish this, I simulated the rank-correspondence between parametric tests and non-parametric equivalents:

 * [Kruskal-Wallis is (almost) a one-way ANOVA on ranked data](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/simulations/simulate_kruskall.html)
 * [Mann-Whitney is (almost) an independent-sample t-test on ranks](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/simulations/simulate_mannwhitney.html)
 * [Spearman is (almost) a Pearson on ranks](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/simulations/simulate_spearman.htmll)
 * [Wilcoxon is (almost) a one-sample t-test on signed ranks](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/simulations/simulate_wilcoxon.html)


## [Utility Theory for Dummies](https://lindeloev.github.io/utility-theory/)
A simple and scalable three-step procedure to apply utility theory to regression.


## [Reaction Time Distributions: An Interactive Overview](http://lindeloev.net/shiny/rt/)
A cheat sheet and a bunch of shiny applets to show various reaction-time friendly distributions and how to fit them using brms. I installed a Shiny server on Google Cloud to get it running.
